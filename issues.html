    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    </h3>

    <h3>Telling myself I should/must perform to a high standard causes me to try harder</h3>
    <p>Having high standards that motivate you to try harder is not the issue. The problem is what you tell yourself
        when you fail to meet those standards and what that evaluation does to your wellbeing. If
        you tell yourself you are a failure, or that you're worthless for not meeting your goal, and that judgment
        leads you to engage in unhelpful behaviours (eg. procrastination) or develop unhelpful negative emotions
        such as shame or depression, are your high standards really serving your best interests? It would be more
        helpful to practise self-acceptance when you don't meet your high standards and view yourself as an
        imperfect human being like anyone else.</p>

    <h3>Why should I work so hard to change my way of thinking when the problem is caused by others?</h3>
    <p>It is understandably frustrating when the problem you have is due to the actions of others that is not under
        your control. If you have tried your utmost to control the situation or influence them, then what other
        option is left? If you were unable to cope or accept their actions, what is the consequence of that for you?
        You can choose to disagree with their behaviour while at the same time accepting it as a unfortunate
        reality.</p>

    <h3>Expecting the worst to happen helps me be prepared for the future</h3>
    <p>There are a few points here worth considering:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>How likely is the worst to happen?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>What could you be doing instead of preparing for the worst case scenario?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Could you cope acceptably well if you were less than completely prepared for the worst?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>This ABC model looks like a lot of work and I am not sure it will work for me</h3>
    <p>There are two possibilities here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't stand the thought of being uncomfortable when working through the ABC model</li>
        <li>You need to know in advance that the ABC model will be effective for you, or else you would you suffer a
            terrible
            outcome (eg. wasted time, increased belief you cannot be helped)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ABC model actively invites us to challenge our usual patterns of thinking. This means that some level of
        discomfort will always be involved, because if you were completely comfortable, you would already be doing it.
        Ask yourself if you are willing to tolerate being less than completely comfortable if it means serving a greater
        purpose.
    </p>
    <p>Is it possible to know if something will work for us before we have tried it? Even if it did not work, would that
        be a complete failure? </p>

    <h3>The problem that is causing me distress is genuinely bad and practicising ABC does not acknowledge
        that</h3>
    <p>Practicising the ABC model does not mean we ignore how bad things can get in life. It means we can view our
        problems as less than completely awful and focus our energy on how to cope best with it with the resources
        available to us. That means things can still go badly for us but we can actively practise unconditional
        acceptance of ourselves (we do not blame ourselves as weak for what happened) and of the situation (we
        acknowledge the situation for what it is and do not waste energy trying to change what cannot be changed).</p>

    <h3>I would be 'going easy on myself' if I were to unconditionally accept myself after making a mistake</h3>
    <p>Unconditionally accepting yourself does not mean you avoid criticising your mistakes altogether. It means you
        do not define yourself by your mistakes. You can acknowledge the negative impact of your action while
        simultaneously accepting yourself. If anything, being excessively critical of yourself is easier way out
        because it excessively simplifies how you view yourself.</p>
    <h3>I cannot identify my own thoughts</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>I cannot identify my unhelpful emotions</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>I understand the ABC model and agree with the disputations to my unhelpful beliefs, but I still
        experience
        the unhelpful emotions</h3>
    <p>
        Ask yourself how strongly you believe in the disputations and the alternative beliefs. At the start, you
        might only have a weak sense of confidence in changing your unhelpful belief. If you wholeheartedly
        accepted the alternative belief as a new way of thinking, what would your life look like?
