        <h3>Telling myself I should/must perform to a high standard causes me to try harder</h3>
        <p>Having high standards that motivate you to try harder is not the issue. The problem is what you tell yourself
            when you fail to meet those standards and what that evaluation does to your wellbeing. If
            you tell yourself you are a failure, or that you're worthless for not meeting your goal, and that judgment
            leads you to engage in unhelpful behaviours (eg. procrastination) or develop unhelpful negative emotions
            such as shame or depression, are your high standards really serving your best interests? It would be more
            helpful to practise self-acceptance when you don't meet your high standards and view yourself as an
            imperfect human being like anyone else.</p>

<h3>Why should I work so hard to change my way of thinking when the problem is caused by others?</h3>
        <p>It is understandably frustrating when the problem you have is due to the actions of others that is not under
            your control. If you have tried your utmost to control the situation or influence them, then what other
            option is left? If you were unable to cope or accept their actions, what is the consequence of that for you?
            You can choose to disagree with their behaviour while at the same time accepting it as a unfortunate
            reality.</p>

        <h3>Expecting the worst to happen helps me be prepared for the future</h3>
            <p>There are a few points here worth considering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>How likely is the worst to happen?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What could you be doing instead of preparing for the worst case scenario?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Could you cope acceptably well if you were less than completely prepared for the worst?</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>This ABC model looks like a lot of work and I am not sure it will work for me</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>The future event that is causing me distress is genuinely bad and practicising ABC does not acknowledge
                that</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>I would be 'going easy on myself' if I were to unconditionally accept myself after making a mistake</h3>
        <p>Unconditionally accepting yourself does not mean you avoid criticising your mistakes altogether. It means you
            do not define yourself by your mistakes. You can acknowledge the negative impact of your action while
            simultaneously accepting yourself. If anything, being excessively critical of yourself is easier way out
            because it excessively simplifies how you view yourself.</p>
        <h3>I cannot identify my own thoughts</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>I cannot identify my unhelpful emotions</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>I understand the ABC model and agree with the disputations to my unhelpful beliefs, but I still
                experience
                the unhelpful emotions</h3>
        <p>
            Ask yourself how strongly you believe in the disputations and the alternative beliefs. At the start, you
            might only have a weak sense of confidence in changing your unhelpful belief. If you wholeheartedly
            accepted the alternative belief as a new way of thinking, what would your life look like?
