    <h2>What is the ABC model?</h2>
    <p>The <i>ABC</i> in <i>ABC</i> model stands for <i>Adversity</i>, <i>Beliefs</i> and
        <i>Consequences</i>.
    </p>

    <p> The ABC model helps us clarify the thoughts we have in a situation that lead us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>form an unhelpful negative emotion</li>
        <li>engage in unhelpful behaviours
            <!-- <aside><i>Unhelpfulness</i> here is defined as anything that is not in your
                best interests, harms you or your
                relationships with others.</aside> -->
        </li>
        <li>generate unhelpful thoughts that further build on the initial thought we had.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whenever we experience an emotion in a situation, it is because we are telling ourselves something about the
        situation. The situation itself does not directly cause us to feel a certain way. Feelings or emotions are
        always indirectly caused by our thoughts about the situation.
    </p>
    <p>Whatever emotions you are experiencing at any time, as distressing as they may be, are completely valid for you
        to feel. You can acknowledge this right now and work at challenging your unhelpful thoughts underlying those
        feelings.</p>
