    <h2>4. Identify unhelpful beliefs</h2>
    <p>
        Unhelpful beliefs are unhelpful because they are rigid and extreme.
    </p>

    <p>Rigid beliefs, or demands, occur when we insist our expectations be met regardless of reality.</p>

    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><small>example</small>:<br />
        <i>I must always succeed.</i><br />
        <i>Others should never let me down.</i><br />
        <i>The world should be predictable.</i>
    </p>
    {% endcall %}


    <p>Unhelpful beliefs are extreme in at least one out of three characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Awfulizing — telling ourselves an adversity is awful, terrible, or completely
            bad</li>
        <li>Discomfort intolerance — describing an adversity as intolerable or
            unable to be coped with</li>
        <li>Global evaluation of worth — judging ourselves, others or a situation as
            wholly negative/worthless based on one aspect</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>When put together, an unhelpful belief takes the following form:</p>
    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><i>I/others/the situation </i><small>should/must</small><i> meet a condition, or else:</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>it would be </i><small>awful</small></li>
        <li><i>it would be </i><small>intolerable</small></li>
        <li><i>it would mean I am/others are/the situation is </i><small>completely bad/a failure/useless</small>.</li>
    </ul>
    {% endcall %}

    <h3>Identifying the demand</h3>

    <p>
        We are going to temporarily assume the adversity in the situation is true. We do this so we can focus on looking
        for the unhelpful beliefs that are determined from the adversity.
    </p>

    <p>
        To identify the rigid belief, or the demand, we can ask:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>What am I insisting should happen for myself, others, or the situation?</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>This question is so important that it is worth asking it every time you are dealing with an unhelpful negative
        emotion. The words <i>should</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>need</i> or <i>have to</i> suggest the
        presence of a demand.</p>

    <details closed>
        <summary>see example</summary>

        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Situation</small>: You get asked a question by your manager that you do not know the answer for<br />
            <small>Adversity</small>: <i>My manager will think I am incompetent because I don't know</i><br />
            <small>Demand</small>: <i>Other people must think I am competent at my job</i>
        </p>
        {% endcall %}
    </details>
    <!-- <p>You might give another adversity as an answer to that. </p> -->

    <p>That said, there are exceptions, when shoulds/musts are used to express:</p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Preferences — <i>I should put less sugar in the dough so the cake is not too sweet for me</i><br />
        Facts — <i>For a fire to start, there should be a source of fuel</i></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>A preference stated this way is not unhelpful because you are simply indicating what you want without insisting.
        If you can replace the <i>should</i> with <i>would like to</i> without any change in how the statement feels to
        you, it is likely a healthy preference.
        <!-- Shoulds become unhelpful when you use them to express an absolute need for something to happen. -->
    </p>


    <h3>Identifying the evaluation</h3>

    <p>
        When we know what we are demanding in an unhelpful belief, we can then work out what we are expecting will
        happen if the demand is not met. This is the <i>evaluation</i>.</p>

    <p>Evaluations are made up of at least one type of extreme belief out of the three below:</p>

    <p> <i>Awfulizing</i> means to view something that is bad or unfortunate and to only see it as completely, 100% bad
        or unfortunate, without considering the possibility of any positive aspects. </p>
    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><small>example</small>:<br />
        <i>It would be terrible if she didn't like me.</i><br />
        <i>If I lost my job it would be simply awful.</i><br />
        {% endcall %}

    <p> <i>Discomfort intolerance</i> occurs when a person states that they cannot tolerate something uncomfortable or
        that
        they cannot be happy with the presence of the intolerable thing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This can be unhelpful because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: by believing you cannot stand something,
        you will likely develop unhelpful feelings (anxiety or anger are common) about yourself or others in a
        situation. </p>
    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><small>example</small>:<br />
        <i>I can't stand not knowing what is going to happen.</i><br />
        <i>I can't tolerate his behaviour.</i><br />
    </p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p> <i>Global negative rating</i> is relying on a single negative evaluation of ourselves, others or the
        world, and to judge the whole person or situation as completely defective.</p>
    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><small>example</small>:<br />
        <i>I am such a failure!</i><br />
        <i>Her son is a loser.</i><br />
        <i>My life sucks.</i>
    </p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>
        We want to keep asking ourselves what is the result of an unmet demand until we come across one of these extreme
        beliefs.</p>
    <p> Identifying the evaluation might require asking the question repeatedly, challenging each belief that pops up,
        to arrive at the most feared scenario. </p>

        <summary>see example</summary>
        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Situation</small>: I forgot to pay a bill</p>
        <p>
            <small>Adversity</small>: <i>I might get fined for not paying a bill.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <small>Question</small>: What would then happen?
        </p>
        <p>
            <small>Answer</small>: <i>I might have less money in my account.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: What's the consequence of that?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: <i>I might not be able to afford something later.</i></p>
        <p>
            Q: What's so bad about that?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: <i>Then I can't have what I need.</i></p>
        <p>
            Q: And if I can't have what I need, what then?
        </p>
        <p>
            A: <b>It would be awful and I wouldn't be able to cope without it.</b>
        </p>

        Talking to another person (a trusted friend, a qualified counsellor) can help a lot with figuring out what
        unhelpful beliefs are being activated in the situation.
