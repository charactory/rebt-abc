    <h2>2. Define the adversity</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>If the situation is the objective account of what happened, then the adversity is the thought that comes to our
        mind regarding the situation. It is the initial, knee-jerk answer to the question <i>What does this situation mean
        for me, others, or the world
        around me?”</i>
    <p></p>
    <p>The adversity is usually a subjective opinion, but it can also be an objective fact about what happened.</p>
    <p></p>
    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><small>example:</small><br />
        <small>Situation</small>: <i>I lost my job.</i><br />
        <small>Adversity</small>: <i>I don’t know how I can pay next fortnight’s bills</i>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>There are usually many possible adversities that can be generated from a situation. It is possible to have
        multiple unhelpful
        negative emotions about a single situation.</p>
    </p>
    <p></p>

    {% call c.s_box() %}
    <p><i>I didn’t try hard enough at work to keep my job</i></p>
    <p><i>I lost the job because my boss doesn’t like me</i></p>
    <p><i>My wife is going to be disappointed in me</i></p>
    <p><i>I won't be able to sleep because of this</i></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p></p>
    <p>Another way of figuring out the adversity to ask yourself what you would want to remove from the situation to
        make the unhelpful negative emotion go away.</p>
