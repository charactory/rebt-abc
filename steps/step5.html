        5. Dispute unhelpful beliefs
    </h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of disputing our unhelpful beliefs is to weaken our perception that the beliefs are true or correct
        and open the possibility for an alternative set of beliefs that are more helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three questions you can use to dispute beliefs:</p>
    <p>

        {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
    <h3>1. Is it realistic?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can challenge how realistic our beliefs are by asking if we have evidence for them.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>This might involve even going out and gathering evidence for the belief.</p> -->

        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>I must be as successful as everyone else</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: What is the evidence that I have to be as successful at everyone else?
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>I can't stand being lonely</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: If I have been lonely in the past and I am still here, that means I can actually
            stand being
            lonely.
        </p>

        {% endcall %}
    </details>



    <p>
    <h3>2. Is it logical?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Disputing the logic of our beliefs is done by questioning ourselves about the assumptions we make and whether
        they are rational.</p>
    <p>
        A common mistake is expressing a desire for something to happen, and extending
        that belief to a demand that it <i>must</i> happen. Just because we want something does not mean it will
        happen; just because we insist that the sun rises in the west does not mean it will.
    </p>

        <summary>see examples</summary>

        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>My partner must never let me down.</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: It is understandable why I don't want to be let down by my partner, but does
            that
            logically
            mean I must never be let down by them?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>I need to know I will like enjoy this holiday before I book the trip.</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: How is it possible to know I will enjoy an experience before I try it?
        </p>
        {% endcall %}
    </details>


    <p>
    <h3>3. Is it helping me?</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Challenging the practical value of our unhelpful beliefs is effective because if the unhelpful belief was
        actually providing us with practical value, it would be helpful, not unhelpful.
    </p>
    <details closed>
        <summary>see examples</summary>

        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>It's so awful that my friends don't call.</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: How does this belief help me with connecting me with my friends? Does it lead me
            to want to
            talk to them more?
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p><small>Belief</small>: <i>I am a failure because I cannot get a job</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: Is calling myself a failure helping me to get a job?
        </p>
        {% endcall %}
    </details>

    {% endcall %}

    <p>Two other questions, which are strictly speaking not part of the ABC model, but may help with convincing yourself
        of the unhelpfulness of your beliefs, are:</p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
    <h3>4. Is it in line with my values?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Values here refer to overall beliefs about how you want to act and think in your life. This covers concepts like
        honesty, patience and courage. Ask yourself if your unhelpful belief is consistent with values you want to hold.
        If they are not, are you prepared to take action that align with your values? And if you are not prepared, would
        you consider changing your values instead?
    </p>
    <p>A full discussion of what values are and their use in challenging beliefs is beyond the scope of this tool, but
        hopefully this provides some ideas to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>5. Would I teach this belief to someone I care about?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>We are often reluctant to let go of our beliefs because of how personal they are to how we define ourselves.
        Questioning whether we would teach this belief to others gets us out of identifying too closely with the beliefs
        and looking at it from the perspective of whether important people in your life to hold the same belief.</p>

    <p>
    <h3>Disputing the adversity</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the demands and any evaluations have been disputed, it is worth examining the evidence for the adversity
        too.
    </p>
    <p>Often the adversity is something we have imagined rather than something we have concrete evidence for.
        Adversities can be invalid if their conclusions are based on assumptions that do not hold up in reality or ones
        that cannot be directly tested.</p>

        {% call c.s_box() %}
        <p><small>Situation</small>: <i>A co-worker frowned at me as I walked past him</i><br />
            <small>Adversity</small>: <i>They don't like me</i><br />
            <small>Disputation</small>: How can I be sure they don't like me? Is there another possible reason why they
            are frowning
            that has nothing to do with me?
