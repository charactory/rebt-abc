    <h2>1. Define the problem</h2>

    <p>The first step is to decide what the problem is.</p>
    <p>If you have been struggling for a long time with many problems, you may not be
        sure which one to work on. </p>
    <p>We sometimes try to find ways to fix obvious problems that actually are attempted solutions to deeper, less
        obvious problems.</p>
    <p>This tool cannot tell you what kind of problem you have. It can only teach you how to think about
        a problem in a different way. </p>

    <!-- This tool cannot help you understand what kind of problem you have. It will only teach you a skill to think about a problem in a different way, which might make it a little less of a problem. -->

    <p>If you are really stuck, write down a list of all the problems and picking one from the list to work
        on. Making a start somewhere is better than not making a start at all.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>
            Identify a specific instance of the problem </p>
    </h3>

    <p>
        Select a time when the problem was an issue for you. Be as specific as possible.
        Pick a specific time even if it has happened many times. This makes it easier to be clear about
        what you were thinking and feeling at the time.
    </p>

    <p>This specific instance is the <i>situation</i>. We define it as the objective account of what is going on.
        It is what a group of impartial observers would agree has happened.</p>
    <p></p>

        <p><small>Problem</small>: <i>I'm not getting along with my partner</i></p>
        <p><small>Situation #1</small>: <i>They criticise me all the time</i></p>
        {% endcall %}

        <p>This situation is too unclear. Trying to practise ABC with this will quickly expand to many issues which can
            become confusing.</p>

        {% call c.box() %}
        <p><small>Situation #2</small>: <i>They criticised me last Tuesday when I tried to help with the dishes</i></p>
        {% endcall %}
        <p>This is much better. The unhelpful thoughts are only about that specific moment.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>
            Consider what you can control or influence
        </p>
    </h3>


    <p>
        Before looking at the ABC model, consider all your options:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
        <small>Direct control</small> — is there something you can do that would directly address the problem? eg.
        starting a
        task you
        are procrastinating on
    </p>
    <p>
        <small>Indirect influence</small> — can you influence the situation to lessen the impact of the problem, eg.
        explaining
        to a loved one why their comments are upsetting
    </p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p></p>
    <p>
        If you have done everything possible or control or influence the problem and you still struggle with unhelpful
        emotions or behaviours, then the last step available is to <i>cope</i> with the situation. This is where the ABC
        model becomes relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning to cope more effectively with unhelpful emotions makes it easier to take action to control or influence
        a problem.
