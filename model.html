<section id="model">
    The <i>ABC model</i> describes how our beliefs in response to a situation largely determine unhelpful thoughts,
    feelings and behaviours. Click on the parts of the model below to learn more.

<section id="activating_event">
    The //Activating Event// is the situation which the unhelpful feelings/behaviours occurred. This  is what objectively happened as what a group of observers would agree upon.

    For the situation to cause some kind of distress, you would have to start telling yourself something about the situation and how it relates to you. This is known as the //Inference//.
    
    To discover the Inference, ask yourself:
    //What is the first thought that came to my mind when it happened?//
    
    Some examples of inferences and their activating events:<span class="emotable">
    <table style="border:1px solid white; width:100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>Activating Event</td>
    <td>Inference</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>My boss frowned as I walked past</td>
    <td>My boss is annoyed at me</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>My girlfriend doesn't want to continue the relationship anymore</td>
    <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>The customer has not replied the email</td>
    <td>  </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table></span>Inferences themselves can be unhelpful as they might be relying on irrational assumptions.
    <span class="emotable"><table style="border:1px solid white; width:100%">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:10px; width: 1px; white-space:nowrap">
    //Activating Event//:
    </td><td style="padding-left:10px; width:99%">
    Partner does not reply your text message
    </td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td style="padding-left:10px; width: 1px; white-space:nowrap">
    //Inference//:
    </td><td style="padding-left:10px; width:99%">
    "She is angry with me"
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table></span>In the ABC model, what we want to do is to //temporarily assume// the Inference is true. This makes it easier to identify the deeper, underlying beliefs which are theorized to cause the most distress for us.
    
    //The exception to the above is if your Activating Event is a //feeling// you are experiencing (ie. feeling ashamed about being angry). The Activating Event would be your subjective experience.//

    <!--
    The Inference is the first thought someone might have when they encounter the Activating Event. It is the immediate and first answer to the question //What does this event mean for me?// -->

<section id="demandingness">
    //Demandingness// means to insist or demand that we, others, or the world conform to our desires. Beliefs of this
    type tend to frequently employ the words "should", "must", or "ought to".

    //Things should go the way I expect them to.//
    //I must succeed.//
    //I must be liked by others.//

    The helpful alternative to a demand is a //preference//. Although we might strongly desire for something to happen a
    certain way, it does not necessarily mean it will happen.

    //I would like things to go as I expect, but unfortunately it does not mean they will.//
    //I would like to succeed, but I acknowledge I may still fail.//
    //I would like others to like me, but I know that may not happen.//

    Note that unhelpful demandingness is unconditional; that is, they absolutely insist the requirement be met. A
    conditional use of shoulds or musts is quite different from this, and merely expresses a recommendation of what a
    person should do to achieve a desired outcome:

    //I should leave my house now so I arrive work on time.//
    //You should read this Italian cookbook so you can make lasagne.//
</section>

<section id="awfulizing">
    //Awfulizing// means to view something that is bad or unfortunate and to only see it as completely, 100% bad or unfortunate, without considering the possibility of any positive aspects. 

    //It would be terrible if she didn't like me.//
    //If I lost my job it would be simply awful.//
    
    The alternative to awfulizing beliefs is to acknowledge the possibility the Activating Event is not completely bad.
    
    //It would be bad if she didn't like me, but it wouldn't be awful.//
    //It would be unpleasant if I lost my job, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.//
</section>

<section id="discomfort_intolerance">
    //Discomfort intolerance// occurs when a person states that cannot tolerate something uncomfortable or that they cannot be happy with the presence of the intolerable thing.

This can be unhelpful because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: by believing you cannot stand something, you will likely develop unhelpful feelings (anxiety or anger are common) about yourself or others in a situation. 

//I can't stand not knowing what is going to happen.//
//I can't tolerate his behaviour.//

The alternative to discomfort intolerance is taking a more moderate position, acknowledging that while it would still be a struggle to tolerate the unpleasant, but it would be possible, and worthwhile to do so.

//I can put up with not knowing what is going to happen even if it is uncomfortable for me.//
//I find it hard to tolerate his behaviour, but I can, and 
</section>

<section id="global_evaluation">
    //Global evaluation of worth// occurs when we make a single negative evaluation of themselves, others or the world, and use it to judge the whole person or situation as completely defective.

    //I'm a failure.//
    //She is a piece of trash.//
