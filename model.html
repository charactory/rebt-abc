        The <i>Activating Event</i> is the situation which the unhelpful feelings/behaviours occurred. This is what
        objectively happened as what a group of observers would agree upon.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the situation to cause some kind of distress, you would have to start telling yourself something about the
        situation and how it relates to you. This is known as the <i>Inference</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To discover the Inference, ask yourself:
    </p>
    <i>What is the first thought that came to my mind when it happened?</i>
    <p>
        Some examples of inferences and their activating events:

    In the ABC model, what we want to do is to <i>temporarily assume</i> the Inference is true. This makes it easier to
    identify the deeper, underlying beliefs which are theorized to cause the most distress for us.

    <i>The exception to the above is if your Activating Event is a </i>feeling<i> you are experiencing (ie. feeling
        ashamed about being angry). The Activating Event would be your subjective experience.</i>


    <!--
    The Inference is the first thought someone might have when they encounter the Activating Event. It is the immediate and first answer to the question //What does this event mean for me?// -->

<section id="beliefs">
    <p>//Beliefs// are unhelpful when they prevent us from achieving our goals and/or harm our relationships with
        others.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Unhelpful beliefs are characterised by being rigid and/or extreme. More helpful beliefs tend to be flexible and
        nonextreme.</p>
    <p></p>
</section>

<section id="demandingness">
    <p> <i>Demandingness</i> means to insist or demand that we, others, or the world conform to our desires. Beliefs of
        this</p>
    <p> type tend to frequently employ the words "should", "must", or "ought to".</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> <i>Things should go the way I expect them to.</p>
    <p> I must succeed.</p>
    <p> I must be liked by others.</i></p>
    <p></p>
    <p> The helpful alternative to a demand is a //preference//. Although we might strongly desire for something to
        happen a</p>
    <p> certain way, it does not necessarily mean it will happen.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> //I would like things to go as I expect, but unfortunately it does not mean they will.//</p>
    <p> //I would like to succeed, but I acknowledge I may still fail.//</p>
    <p> //I would like others to like me, but I know that may not happen.//</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Note that unhelpful demandingness is unconditional; that is, they absolutely insist the requirement be met. A
    </p>
    <p> conditional use of shoulds or musts is quite different from this, and merely expresses a recommendation of what
        a</p>
    <p> person should do to achieve a desired outcome:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> //I should leave my house now so I arrive work on time.//</p>
    <p> //You should read this Italian cookbook so you can make lasagne.//</p>

<section id="awfulizing">
    <p> //Awfulizing// means to view something that is bad or unfortunate and to only see it as completely, 100% bad or
        unfortunate, without considering the possibility of any positive aspects. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> //It would be terrible if she didn't like me.//</p>
    <p> //If I lost my job it would be simply awful.//</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> The alternative to awfulizing beliefs is to acknowledge the possibility the Activating Event is not completely
        bad.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> //It would be bad if she didn't like me, but it wouldn't be awful.//</p>
    <p> //It would be unpleasant if I lost my job, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.//</p>

<section id="discomfort_intolerance">
    <p> <i>Discomfort intolerance</i> occurs when a person states that cannot tolerate something uncomfortable or that they
        cannot be happy with the presence of the intolerable thing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This can be unhelpful because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: by believing you cannot stand something,
        you will likely develop unhelpful feelings (anxiety or anger are common) about yourself or others in a
        situation. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><i>I can't stand not knowing what is going to happen.</i></p>
    <p><i>I can't tolerate his behaviour.</i></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The alternative to discomfort intolerance is taking a more moderate position, acknowledging that while it would
        still be a struggle to tolerate the unpleasant, but it would be possible, and worthwhile to do so.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><i>I can put up with not knowing what is going to happen even if it is uncomfortable for me.</i></p>
    <p><i>I find it hard to tolerate his behaviour, but I can, and </i></p>
