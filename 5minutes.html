    <h2>The ABC model in 5 minutes</h2>
    <p>The following steps are an outline of the method used in the ABC model to change our own thoughts.</p>
    <hr>
    <ol class="fivemin" style="margin-left:0px;">
        <li>Think of a problem that is affecting you</li>
        <li>Think of a specific time the problem was an issue for you</li>
        <li>Do anything that can be done about the problem</li>
        <li>Define the situation (what objectively happened in that specific time)</li>
        <li>Define the adversity (what was your subjective take-away or conclusion from the situation)</li>
        <li>List the consequences for you due to the adversity:
            <ul>
                <li>unhelpful negative emotions (depression, anxiety, anger, hurt, guilt, shame, jealousy or envy)</li>
                <li>unhelpful thoughts and behaviours (eg. avoidance, substance use)</li>
                <li>secondary emotions (having feelings about your feelings)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set a goal for what you want to change about your response to the situation</li>
        <li>Define the demand by asking yourself what you believed <i>should</i> or <i>must</i> happen</li>
        <li>Define the evaluation by asking yourself what you thought would happen if your expectation is not met<br />
            Keep asking until you express a statement with at least one of the following extreme beliefs:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>awfulizing (saying something is awful/completely bad), </li>
                <li>discomfort intolerance (saying you can't stand or tolerate something)</li>
                <li>global negative rating (negatively judging yourself or others' worth wholly based on one aspect)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>State your unhelpful belief in full: <i>when the adversity happened, I had the demand that a condition must be met, and if it did not, I or others would suffer the negative outcome in the evaluation</i></li>
        <li>Dispute the demand and the evaluations by questioning how logical, realistic or practical they are</li>
        <li>Dispute the adversity by examining evidence for it</li>
        <li>Create a new effective belief that is flexible and non-extreme</li>
        <li>Practise new thoughts and behaviours consistent with your new effective belief</li>

    </ol>
