    <h2>Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory</h2>

    <p>This questionnaire asks about how you manage and respond to your emotions. Please score the

            you.</b> Circle one answer for each statement.</p>

        sadness, anger, or fear. The second half asks about <i>good</i> or <i>pleasant</i> emotions, this means emotions
        like happiness, amusement, or excitement.
