<section id="emotions">

    This is a list of unhelpful emotions that we typically focus on in REBT. You can click/tap on each one to read more about how they can negatively affect your thoughts and behaviours.
    Note that the absence of some of these unhelpful negative emotions is not positive emotion, but an //unhelpful negative emotion//. It would be unrealistic if we felt good about something bad happened to us.      
    <i>A negative emotion can be helpful if it leads us to take meaningful action to resolve a problem.</i>
    
    If you are in distress and are unsure what feelings you are experiencing, it might be helpful to read through the lists of thoughts and behaviours for each feeling to see which ones you are engaged in.
    
    You can take a quick [[Emotion Assessment]] to figure out what feelings you might be experiencing.
