<section id="emotions">

  <p>
    There are many words we can use to describe our emotions and several attempts have been made to categorise emotions
    to allow us to better study them.</p>
  <p>
    The emotions we are interested in addressing in therapy tend to be unhelpful ones that cause us suffering and
    prevent us from reaching our goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The emotions described here are not a definitive list of all emotion words, and in some cases the words we commonly
    use to describe emotions are better understood as a combination of beliefs and emotions. Understanding the
    distinction and having the capability to accurate describe our inner emotional state is key to good mental health.
  </p>

  <p>This is a list of unhelpful emotions that we typically focus on in REBT. Note that the absence of some of these
    unhelpful negative emotions is not positive emotion, but an <i>unhelpful negative emotion</i>. It would be
    unrealistic if we
    felt good about something bad happened to us.</p>

  <p><i>A negative emotion can be helpful if it leads us to take meaningful action to resolve a problem.</i></p>
