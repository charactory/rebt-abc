    1.1 Decide on a problem to work on and identify a specific instance it happened
    <p>
        You want to be as specific as possible. Even if a problem has occurred many times, it helps to pinpoint a specific instance so you can be clear about what you were thinking and feeling at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.2 Determine if there is anything practical you can do to resolve the problem</p>
    <p>
        Engaging in problem solving might be enough sometimes, but often even if we can do something practical to solve a problem, we might still be emotionally disturbed about it. The ABC procedure can help us cope with unhelpful negative emotions that occur in the presence of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have done everything possible or control or influence the problem and you still struggle with unhelpful emotions or behaviours, and you are willing to accept the presence of the problem while trying to reduce its negative impact by rethinking how you are interpreting the problem/situation, then continue.

<div id="step2" style="display:none;">
    <p>2.1 Ask yourself what emotions you felt and behaviours you expressed when you had the activating event at the time the situation occurred.</p>
    <p>Read the section on [[Emotions]] or take the [[Emotion Assessment]] to figure out what you were feeling.</p>

    <p>4. Set a goal with respect to the problem</p>

    <p> Remember that if you are experiencing an adversity, you are likely to experience some form of negative emotion, so setting a goal of having positive or no negative emotion would be unrealistic and unhelpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is most helpful if your goal is a behavioural one -- ie. what you would be doing differently if you were coping more effectively with the problem.</p>

{{c.hidestep('step3', '3. Identify Unhelpful Beliefs')}}

<p>
<div id="step3" style="display:none;">
    <p>3.1 The structure of an unhelpful belief takes the following form with up to four different components: demandingness,awfulizing, discomfort intolerance and global evaluation of worth.</p>
    <p>
        See [[Beliefs]] for more information on each component.</p>
    <p>
        From this template, ask yourself:</p>
    - What am I insisting should happen for myself, others, or the situation?
    - What does this belief say about me/others/the situation?

    We want to keep asking ourselves what is the result of a belief until we reach the end, where we usually express a
    global negative sentiment about:

    1. Ourselves
    2. Others
    3. The situation, the world, the future, etc

    It might take some time to identify the unhelpful belief, and figuring out what the evaluation is might require
    asking the question repeatedly. For example:
    <span class="emotable">
        I might get fined for not paying a bill.
        What would then happen?
        I might have less money in my account.
        What's the consequence of that?
        I might not be able to afford something later.
        What's so bad about that?
        Then I can't have what I need.
        And if you can't have what you need, what then?
        It would be terrible and I wouldn't be able to cope without it.
    </span>
    Talking to a clinician will help a lot with figuring out what unhelpful beliefs are being activated in the
    situation.

{{c.hidestep('step4', '4. Dispute Unhelpful Beliefs')}}

<p>
<div id="step4" style="display:none;">
    The three questions to dispute beliefs are:

    - Is it realistic?
    Quite often we can hold unrealistic beliefs without even being aware of them. A common one is a belief that we must
    be approved or liked by everybody.

    - Is it helping me?

    - Is it logical?


    - Is it in line with my values?
    - Would I teach this belief to someone I care about?

{{c.hidestep('step5', '5. Devise Helpful Alternative Belief')}}

<p>
<div id="step5" style="display:none;">
    Now that you have successfully challenged your original unhelpful belief, the last step is to come up with a new
    belief that will be more helpful for you.

    Recall the template of an unhelpful belief:
