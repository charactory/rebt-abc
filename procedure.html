    <h2>What is the ABC Model?</h2>
    <p>The <i>ABC</i> in <i>ABC</i> model stands for <i>Adversity</i>, <i>Beliefs</i> and
        <i>Consequences</i>.
    </p>
    <p> The ABC model describes how the beliefs we have about an adversity in a situation largely determine the
        consequences for us.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever we experience an emotion in a situation, it is because we are telling ourselves something about the
        situation. The situation itself does not directly cause us to feel a certain way; it is always the thoughts
        about the situation that does.
    </p>
    <p> The ABC model helps us clarify the thoughts we have in a situation that lead us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>form an unhelpful negative emotion</li>
        <li>engage in unhelpful behaviours</li>
        <aside><i>Unhelpfulness</i> here is defined as anything that is not in your best interests, harms you or your
            relationships with others.</aside>
        <li>generate unhelpful thoughts that further build on the initial thought we had.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Define the Problem</h2>

    <p>The first step is to decide what the problem is.</p>
    <p>If you have been struggling for a long time with many problems, you may not be
        sure which one to work on. </p>
    <p>We sometimes try to find ways to fix obvious problems that actually are attempted solutions to deeper, less
        obvious problems.</p>
    <p>This tool cannot tell you what kind of problem you have. It can only teach you how to think about
        a problem in a different way. </p>

    <!-- This tool cannot help you understand what kind of problem you have. It will only teach you a skill to think about a problem in a different way, which might make it a little less of a problem. -->

    <p>If you are really stuck, write down a list of all the problems and picking one from the list to work
        on. Making a start somewhere is better than not making a start at all.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>
            Identify a specific instance of the problem </p>
    </h3>

    <p>
        Select a time when the problem was an issue for you. Be as specific as possible.
        Even if a problem has occurred many times, it helps to pinpoint a specific instance so you can be clear about
        what you were thinking and feeling at the time.
    </p>

    <p>We call this specific instance the <i>situation</i>. We define it as the objective account of what is going on.
        It is what a group of impartial observers would agree has happened.</p>
    <p></p>

        <summary>see example</summary>
        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>Problem: <i>I'm not getting along with my partner</i></p>
        <p>Attempt #1 at defining situation: <i>They criticise me all the time</i></p>
        {% endcall %}

        <p>This situation is too unclear. Trying to practise ABC with this will quickly expand to many issues which can
            become confusing.</p>

        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>Attempt #2: <i>They criticised me last Tuesday when I tried to help with the dishes</i></p>
        {% endcall %}
        <p>This is much better. The unhelpful thoughts are only about that specific moment.</p>
    </details>



    <h3>
        <p>
            Consider Your Options
        </p>
    </h3>


    <p>
        Before looking at the ABC model, consider your options:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
        <small>Direct control</small> — is there something you can do that would directly address the problem? eg.
        starting a
        task you
        are procrastinating on
    </p>
    <p>
        <small>Indirect influence</small> — can you influence the situation to lessen the impact of the problem, eg.
        explaining
        to a loved one why their comments are upsetting
    </p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p></p>
    <p>
        If you have done everything possible or control or influence the problem and you still struggle with unhelpful
        emotions or behaviours, then the last step available is to <i>cope</i> with the situation. This is where the ABC
        model becomes relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning to cope more effectively with unhelpful emotions is helpful whenever you have a problem as it would be
        more difficult to control or influence a situation when your emotions are hindering you from taking action.

    <h2>2. Define the Adversity</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>If the situation is the objective account of what happened, then the adversity is the thought that comes to our
        mind regarding the situation. It is the initial, knee-jerk answer to the question “What does this situation mean
        for me, others, or the world
        around me?”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The adversity is usually a subjective opinion, but it can also be an objective fact about what happened.</p>
    <p></p>
    <details closed>
        <summary>see example</summary>
        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>Situation: <i>I lost my job.</i></p>
        <p>Adversity: <i>I don’t know how I can pay next fortnight’s bills</i></p>
        <p></p>
        {% endcall %}

        <p>There are usually many possible adversities that can be generated from a situation. It is possible to have
            multiple unhelpful
            negative emotions about a single situation.</p>
        </p>
        <p></p>

        {% call c.box() %}
        <p><i>I didn’t try hard enough at work to keep my job</i></p>
        <p><i>I lost the job because my boss doesn’t like me</i></p>
        <p><i>My wife is going to be disappointed in me</i></p>
        <p><i>I won't be able to sleep because of this</i></p>
        {% endcall %}
    </details>

    <p></p>
    <p>Another way of figuring out the adversity to ask yourself what you would want to remove from the situation to
        make the unhelpful negative emotion go away.</p>

    <h2>3. Identify Consequences</h2>

    <p>
        Consequences in the ABC model refer to the negative effect of your beliefs about the adversity. This effect can
        be made up of thoughts, emotions and behaviours.

    <h3>
        Identify secondary emotions
    </h3>
    <p>When we experience an unhelpful negative emotion, we might also have an emotional response to the initial
        emotion. These are known as secondary emotions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In practice, this means we can be depressed about getting angry, shameful about being depressed, anxious about
        being jealous, and so on.</p>

        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>
            <span class="smallcap">Situation</span>: You are anxious
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="smallcap">Adversity</span>: <i>Anxiety means something bad will happen</i>

    </details>

    <p></p>
    <p>The initial, primary emotion becomes a new situation and corresponding adversity which activates another
        unhelpful belief that leads to the unhelpful negative emotion.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Consider which emotion is the most problematic for you. Addressing the secondary emotion might be more helpful
        if it liberates you to focus on the primary emotion more effectively.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>
            Set a goal for the problem
        </p>
    </h3>
    <p>
        When you are sure what the situation is and how it impacted you, think about a goal of what you want to change.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are experiencing an adversity, you are likely to experience some form of negative emotion,
        so setting a goal of having positive or no negative emotion would be unrealistic and unhelpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Behavioral goals are the most helpful — ie. what you would be doing differently if you were
        coping more effectively with the problem.

    <h2>4. Identify Unhelpful Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
        Unhelpful beliefs are unhelpful because they are rigid and extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have rigid and extreme beliefs, we are insisting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> that our expectations must be met regardless of what the reality is (rigid)</li>
        <li>and if the expectation is not met, we would suffer an insurmountable negative outcome (extreme)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        See {{c.link('beliefs', "Beliefs")}} for more information on rigid and extreme beliefs.</p>

    <h3>Identifying the demand</h3>

    <p>
        We are going to temporarily assume the adversity in the situation is true. We do this so we can focus on looking
        for the unhelpful beliefs that are determined from the adversity.
    </p>

    <p>
        To identify the rigid belief, or the demand, we can ask:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>What am I insisting should happen for myself, others, or the situation?</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>This question is so important that it is worth asking it every time you are dealing with an unhelpful negative
        emotion. The presence of the words <i>should</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>need</i> or <i>have to</i> suggest the presence of a demand.</p>
    <!-- <p>You might give another adversity as an answer to that. </p> -->

    <p>That said, the use of the word <i>should</i>, <i>must</i> or similar does not necessarily indicate a problematic demand. Shoulds can be used
        to
        express:</p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Preference: <i>I should put less sugar in the dough so the cake is not too sweet for me</i></p>
    <p>Fact: <i>For a fire to start, there should be a source of fuel</i></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>Shoulds become unhelpful when you use them to express an absolute need for something to happen.
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>I must always succeed.</i></p>
    <p><i>Others should never let me down.</i></p>
    <p><i>Life should be fair.</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <h3>Identifying the evaluation</h3>

    <p>
        When we know what we are demanding in an unhelpful belief, we can then work out what we are expecting will
        happen if the demand is not met. This is the <i>evaluation</i>.</p>
    <p>
        We want to keep asking ourselves what is the result of an unmet demand until we reach a point where we express a
        global
        negative sentiment about one or more of the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Self</li>
        <li>
            Others</li>
        <li>
            The situation, the world, or the future</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Identifying the evaluation might require asking the question repeatedly, challenging each belief that pops up,
        to arrive at the most feared scenario. </p>

        5. Dispute Unhelpful Beliefs
    </h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of disputing our unhelpful beliefs is to weaken our perception that the beliefs are true or correct
        and open the possibility for an alternative set of beliefs that are more helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three questions you can use to dispute beliefs:</p>
    <p>

        {% call c.box() %}
    <h3>1. Is it realistic?</h3>
    <p>
        Asking ourselves what is the evidence for our unhelpful belief is how we can challenge how realistic the belief
        is.
    </p>
    <p>This might involve even going out and gathering evidence for the belief.</p>

    <details closed>
        <summary>see examples</summary>
        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>Belief: <i>I must be as successful as everyone else</i></p>
        <p>Disputation: What is the evidence that I have to be as successful at everyone else?</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>Belief: <i>I can't stand being lonely</i></p>
        <p>Disputation: If I have been lonely in the past and I am still here, that means I can actually stand being
            lonely.</p>

        {% endcall %}
    </details>



    <p>
    <h3>2. Is it logical?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Disputing the logic of our beliefs is done by questioning ourselves about the assumptions we make and whether
        they are rational.</p>
    <p>
        A common illogical aspect of an unhelpful belief is begin with a desire for something to happen, and to extend
        that belief to a demand that it must happen. Just because we want something does not mean it will
        happen; just because we insist that the sun rises in the west does not mean it will.

        <p>Disputation: It is understandable why I don't want to be let down by my partner, but does that
            logically

    <h3>3. Is it helping me?</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Challenging the practical value of our unhelpful beliefs is effective because if the unhelpful belief was
        actually providing us with practical value, it would be helpful, not unhelpful.

        {% call c.box() %}
        <p>Belief: <i>It's so awful that my friends don't call.</i></p>
        <p>Disputation: How does this belief help me with connecting you with my friends? Does it lead me to want to
            talk to them more?</p>

    <p>Two other questions, which are strictly speaking not part of the ABC model, but may help with convincing yourself
        of the unhelpfulness of your beliefs, are:</p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
    <h3>4. Is it in line with my values?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Values here refer to overall beliefs about how you want to act and think in your life. This covers concepts like
        honesty, patience and courage. Ask yourself if your unhelpful belief is consistent with values you want to hold.
        If they are not, are you prepared to take action that align with your values? And if you are not prepared, would
        you consider changing your values instead?
    </p>
    <p>A full discussion of what values are and their use in challenging beliefs is beyond the scope of this tool.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>5. Would I teach this belief to someone I care about?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>We are often reluctant to let go of our beliefs because of how personal they are to how we define ourselves.
        Questioning whether we would teach this belief to others gets us out of identifying too closely with the beliefs
        and looking at it from the perspective of whether important people in your life to hold the same belief.</p>

    <h3>Disputing the Adversity</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the demands and any evaluations have been disputed, it is worth examining the evidence for the adversity
        too.
    </p>
    <p>Often the adversity is something we have imagined rather than something we have concrete evidence for.
        Adversities can be invalid if their conclusions are based on assumptions that do not hold up in reality or ones
        that cannot be directly tested.</p>

        <p>Adversity: <i>They don't like me</i></p>
        <p>Disputation: How can I be sure they don't like me? Is there another possible reason why they are frowning
            that has nothing to do with me?</p>

        6. Formulate Helpful New Beliefs
    </h2>

    <p>
        Having disputed the original unhelpful belief, we need to replace it with a new one that is
        more effective by being more logical, realistic, practical and in line with our values.</p>
    <p>
        If an unhelpful belief is characterised by demandingness, awfulizing, discomfort intolerance and global negative
        evaluation, then a helpful belief is one that is phrased as a preference, non-awfulizing, accepts the presence
        of discomfort
        and refrains from global ratings of worth.
    </p>

    <h3>Demand 🠢 Preference</h3>
    <p>
        A preference is distinct from a demand as it indicates we would like something to happen, without insisting that
        it
        needs to happen.</p>
    <p>
        This does not mean giving up wanting something important. It means being able to gracefully acknowledge the
        possibility of not getting what we want.
    </p>
    <p>If this was put into a statement it would sound like:</p>

    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>Although I would like really like my son to do well at school, I can accept that he might not.</i></p>
    <p><i>I would like the world to be fair, but I can acknowledge that it isn't the case.</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>It is easy to slip from a strongly held preference to a demand, so be careful about the distinction between the
        two. </p>


    <h3>Awfulizing 🠢 Non-Awfulizing</h3>

    <p>Changing an awfulizing belief to a non-awfulizing belief means viewing the adversity as: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>less than completely 100 per cent bad
        </li>
        <li>surmountable</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Discomfort Intolerance 🠢 Discomfort Tolerance</h3>
    <p>Changing a discomfort intolerance belief to a discomfort tolerance belief means viewing the adversity as: </p>

    <h3>Global Evaluation of Worth 🠢 Unconditional Acceptance</h3>
