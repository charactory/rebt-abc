    <h2>What is the ABC Model?</h2>
    <p>The <i>ABC</i> in <i>ABC</i> model stands for <i>Adversity</i>, <i>Beliefs</i> and
        <i>Consequences</i>.
    </p>
    <p> The ABC model describes how the beliefs we have about an adversity in a situation largely determine the
        consequences for us.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever we experience an emotion in a situation, it is because we are telling ourselves something about the
        situation. These beliefs can take some time and effort for us to uncover them.
    </p>
    <p> The ABC model helps us clarify the thoughts we have in a situation that lead us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>form an unhelpful negative emotion</li>
        <li>subsequently engage in unhelpful behaviours</li>
        <aside><i>Unhelpfulness</i> here is defined as anything that is not in your best interests, harms you or your
            relationships with others.</aside>
        <li>generate unhelpful thoughts that further build on the initial thought we had.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Define the Problem</h2>

    <p>The first step is to decide what the problem is.</p>
    <p>This can be harder than you think. If you have been struggling for a long time with many problems, you may not be
        sure which one to work on. </p>
    <p>We sometimes try to find ways to fix obvious problems that actually are attempted solutions to deeper, less
        obvious problems.</p>
    <p>This tool cannot tell you what kind of problem you have. It can only teach you how to think about
        a problem in a different way. </p>

    <!-- This tool cannot help you understand what kind of problem you have. It will only teach you a skill to think about a problem in a different way, which might make it a little less of a problem. -->

    <p>If you are really stuck, write down a list of all the problems and picking one from the list to work
        on. Making a start somewhere is better than not making a start at all.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>
            Identify a specific instance of the problem </p>
    </h3>

    <p>
        Next, select a time when the problem was an issue for you. Be as specific as possible.
        Even if a problem has occurred many times, it helps to pinpoint a specific instance so you can be clear about
        what you were thinking and feeling at the time.
    </p>

    <p>We call this specific instance the <i>situation</i>. We define it as the objective account of what is going on.
        It is what a group of impartial observers would agree has happened.</p>
    <p></p>


    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Problem: <i>I'm not getting along with my partner</i></p>
    <p>Attempt #1 at defining situation: <i>They criticise me all the time</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>This situation is too unclear. Trying to practise ABC with this will quickly expand to many issues which
        makes it harder to challenge thoughts.</p>

    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Attempt #2: <i>They criticised me last Tuesday when I tried to help with the dishes</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>This is much better. The unhelpful thoughts are only about that specific moment.</p>


    <h3>
        <p>
            Determine what you can control or influence
        </p>
    </h3>


    <p>
        Before looking at the ABC model, consider your options:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
        <i>Direct control</i> -- is there something you can do that would directly address the problem? eg. starting a
        task you
        are procrastinating on
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Indirect influence</i> -- can you influence the situation to lessen the impact of the problem, eg.
        explaining
        to a loved one why their comments are upsetting
    </p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p></p>
    <p>
        If you have done everything possible or control or influence the problem and you still struggle with unhelpful
        emotions or behaviours, then the last step available is to <i>cope</i> with the situation. This is where the ABC
        model becomes relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning to cope more effectively with unhelpful emotions is helpful whenever you have a problem as it would be
        more difficult to control or influence a situation when your emotions are hindering you from taking action.

    <h2>2. Define the Adversity</h2>

    <p></p>
    <p>If the situation is the objective account of what happened, then the adversity is the thought that comes to our
        mind regarding the situation. It is the initial, knee-jerk answer to the question “What does this situation mean
        for me, others, or the world
        around me?”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The adversity is usually a subjective opinion, but it can also be an objective fact about what happened.</p>
    <p></p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Situation: <i>I lost my job.</i></p>
    <p>Adversity: <i>I don’t know how I can pay next fortnight’s bills</i></p>
    <p></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>There are usually many possible adversities generated from a situation, so using the same example:</p>
    <p></p>

    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>I didn’t try hard enough at work to keep my job</i></p>
    <p><i>I lost the job because my boss doesn’t like me</i></p>
    <p><i>My wife is going to be disappointed in me</i></p>
    <p><i>I won't be able to sleep because of this</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p></p>
    <p>Different adversities generate different types of unhelpful emotions. It is possible to have multiple unhelpful
        negative emotions about a single situation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Another way of figuring out the adversity to ask yourself what you would want to remove from the situation to
        make the unhelpful negative emotion go away.</p>

    <h3>
        Identify secondary emotions
    </h3>
    <p>When we experience an unhelpful negative emotion, we might also have an emotional response to the initial
        emotion. These are known as secondary emotions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In practice, this means we can be depressed about getting angry, shameful about being depressed, anxious about
        being jealous, and so on.</p>

    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Example of problematic worrying:</p>
    <p>
        <b>Situation</b>: You are anxious
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Adversity</b>: <i>Anxiety means something bad will happen</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Belief</b>: <i>I must not be anxious otherwise I couldn't stand it</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Consequence</b>: Anxiety continues to worsen
    </p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p></p>
    <p>The initial, primary emotion becomes a new situation and corresponding adversity which activates another
        unhelpful belief that leads to the unhelpful negative emotion.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Consider which emotion is the most problematic for you. Addressing the secondary emotion might be more helpful
        if it liberates you to focus on the primary emotion more effectively.</p>


    <h3>
        <p>
            Set a goal for the problem
        </p>
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you are experiencing an adversity, you are likely to experience some form of negative emotion,
        so setting a goal of having positive or no negative emotion would be unrealistic and unhelpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Behavioral goals are the most helpful -- ie. what you would be doing differently if you were
        coping more effectively with the problem.

    <h2>4. Identify Unhelpful Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
        Unhelpful beliefs are unhelpful because they are rigid and extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have rigid and extreme beliefs, we are insisting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> that our expectations must be met regardless of what the reality is (rigid)</li>
        <li>and if the expectation is not met, we would suffer an insurmountable negative outcome (extreme)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        See {{c.link('beliefs', "Beliefs")}} for more information on rigid and extreme beliefs.</p>

    <h3>Identifying the demand</h3>
    <p>
        To identify the rigid belief, or the demand, we can ask:
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>What am I insisting should happen for myself, others, or the situation?</i></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <!-- <p>You might give another adversity as an answer to that. </p> -->


    <p>Note: use of the word "should" or "must" does not necessarily indicate a problematic demand. Shoulds can be used
        to
        express:</p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>Preference: <i>I should put less sugar in the dough so the cake is not too sweet for me</i></p>
    <p>Fact</i>: <i>For a fire to start, there should be a source of fuel</i></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>Shoulds become unhelpful when you use them to express an absolute need for something to happen.
    </p>
    {% call c.box() %}
    <p><i>I must always succeed.</i></p>
    <p><i>Others should never let me down.</i></p>
    <p><i>Life should be fair.</i></p>
    {% endcall %}

    <h3>Identifying the evaluation</h3>

    <p>
        When we know what we are demanding in an unhelpful belief, we can then work out what we are expecting will
        happen if the demand is not met. This is the <i>evaluation</i>.</p>
    <p>
        We want to keep asking ourselves what is the result of an unmet demand until we reach a point where we express a
        global
        negative sentiment about one or more of the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Self</li>
        <li>
            Others</li>
        <li>
            The situation, the world, or the future</li>
    </ol>
    <p> It might take some time to identify the unhelpful beliefs, and arriving at the evaluation might require
        asking the question repeatedly. For example:</p>

    {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
        I might get fined for not paying a bill.</p>
    <p>
        <i>What would then happen?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        I might have less money in my account.</p>
    <p>
        <i>What's the consequence of that?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        I might not be able to afford something later.</p>
    <p>
        <i>What's so bad about that?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I can't have what I need.</p>
    <p>
        <i>And if you can't have what you need, what then?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>It would be awful and I wouldn't be able to cope without it.</b>
    </p>

    {% endcall %}
    <p>
        Talking to another person (a trusted friend, a qualified counsellor) can help a lot with figuring out what
        unhelpful beliefs are being activated in the situation.

    <h2>
        5. Dispute Unhelpful Beliefs
    </h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of disputing our unhelpful beliefs is to weaken our perception that the beliefs are true or correct
        and open the possibility for an alternative set of beliefs that are more helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three questions you can use to dispute beliefs:</p>
    <p>
        {% call c.box() %}
    <h3>1. Is it realistic?</h3>
    <p>
        Asking ourselves what is the evidence for our unhelpful belief is how we can challenge how realistic the belief
        is.
    </p>
    <p>This might involve even going out and gathering evidence for the belief.</p>



    <p>
    <h3>2. Is it logical?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Disputing the logic of our beliefs is done by questioning ourselves about the assumptions we make and whether
        they are rational.</p>
    <p>
        A common illogical aspect of an unhelpful belief is begin with a desire for something to happen, and to extend
        that belief to a demand that it must happen. Just because we want something does not mean it will
        happen; just because we insist that the sun rises in the west does not mean it will.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>3. Is it helping me?</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        Challenging the practical value of our unhelpful beliefs is effective because if the unhelpful belief was
        actually providing us with practical value, it would be helpful, not unhelpful.
    </p>

    {% endcall %}

    <p>Two other questions, which are strictly speaking not part of the ABC model, but may help with convincing yourself
        of the unhelpfulness of your beliefs, are:</p>
        {% call c.box() %}
    <p>
    <h3>4. Is it in line with my values?</h3>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
    <h3>5. Would I teach this belief to someone I care about?</h3>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    {% endcall %}
    <p>
    <h3>Disputing the Adversity</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the demands and any evaluations have been disputed, it is worth examining the evidence for the adversity
        too.
    </p>
    <p>Often the adversity is something we have imagined rather than something we have concrete evidence for.
        Adversities can be invalid if their conclusions are based on assumptions that do not hold up in reality or ones
        that cannot be directly tested.</p>
