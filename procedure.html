    ''1. Decide on a problem to work on and identify a specific instance it happened''

    You want to be as specific as possible. Even if a problem has occurred many times, it helps to pinpoint a specific
    instance so you can be clear about what you were thinking and feeling at the time.

    ''2. Ask yourself if there is anything practical you can do to resolve the problem.''
    Engaging in problem solving might be enough sometimes, but often even if we can do something practical to solve a
    problem, we might still be emotionally disturbed about it. The ABC procedure can help us cope with unhelpful
    negative emotions that occur in the presence of the problem.

    If you have done everything possible or control or influence the problem and you still struggle with unhelpful
    emotions or behaviours, and you are willing to accept the presence of the problem while trying to reduce its
    negative impact by rethinking how you are interpreting the problem/situation, then continue.

    ''3. Ask yourself what emotions you felt and behaviours you expressed when you had the activating event at the
    time the situation occurred.''

    Read the section on [[Emotions]] or take the [[Emotion Assessment]] to figure out what you were feeling.

    ''4. Set a goal with respect to the problem''
    Remember that if you are experiencing an adversity, you are likely to experience some form of negative emotion, so
    setting a goal of having positive or no negative emotion would be unrealistic and unhelpful.

    It is most helpful if your goal is a behavioural one -- ie. what you would be doing differently if you were coping
    more effectively with the problem.
